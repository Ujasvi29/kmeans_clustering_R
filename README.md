# kmeans_clustering_R
This project uses K-Means clustering, an unsupervised learning technique, to group the Iris dataset based only on numeric features without using species labels. It shows how natural patterns can be identified in data and evaluates how well the clusters match actual flower species, highlighting the role of unsupervised learning in data analysis.

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to perform unsupervised analysis on numerical data and identify natural groupings based on feature similarity. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, clustering with an optimal number of clusters, and visualizing results using scatter plots. Clustering performance is evaluated using statistical measures and comparisons with actual categories to understand the effectiveness and limitations of the algorithm. The project highlights the practical use of unsupervised learning techniques for exploratory data analysis and pattern discovery.
