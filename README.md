# kmeans_clustering_R
This project uses K-Means clustering, an unsupervised learning technique, to group the Iris dataset based only on numeric features without using species labels. It shows how natural patterns can be identified in data and evaluates how well the clusters match actual flower species, highlighting the role of unsupervised learning in data analysis.
